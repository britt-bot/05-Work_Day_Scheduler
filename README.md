# 05-Work Day Scheduler
Homework 05 - Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Description:
This is a day scheduler. The hours should change color based on the current time and the user should be able to enter text and then click the save button to save the text, so that on page reload the information stays. That is the only thing I have no figured out at this point. :(
